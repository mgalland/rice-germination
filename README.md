## Results
- Germination physiology (untouched mostly)
- Proteome analyses (non modified)
- Transcriptome analyses (non modified)
- The proteomes of the endosperm and embryo show contrasted changes: down- and up- accumulated in the embryo, mostly down in the endosperm
- The mRNA profile of the endosperm shows, on the contrary, that a lot is happening (up and down). This could be due mostly to the aleurone layer + to the fact that the mRNA are amplified before microarray hybridization (not possible for shotgun proteomics)
- Compare profiles of down-accumulated proteins of the endosperm (n = 94 proteins) with their corresponding mRNA profiles over germination. Same for the embryo. Goal = find matching profiles (down - down, up - up) or inconsistent ones.  

## Main sections of the discussion
- Signalling & Hormones for dry > germinated transition: GID1, Moco CNX, DOG1L-2, MFT.    
- Post-translational modifications dry > germinated: PIMT, FBK56 peptidyl-prolyl isomerase, others?  
- Oxidation protection? Amino acid recycling? Glutelin up-accumulated in the embryo (LOC_Os01g55690).  
- Alpha-amylases detected in embryo and endosperm. Fueling germination with energy. Another role?  
- TCA, Aspartate, Methionine, SAM super-pathway: difference with the Arabidopsis metabolic model of germination.
